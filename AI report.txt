## AI Tools Used

    -Primary tool: Cursor IDE, Claude, Chatgpt
    -Key use cases: Learnt about the tech stack that is used in this project.
                    Added animations in the landing page.
                    For structuring the folder.



## Sample Prompts

    1. Create a folder structure for the task B (explained both the tasks earlier to the AI model) and add all the files that would be needed for this task to complete. - Cursor AI
    2. As the basic structure given and the points explained above about the project, generate a beautiful looking website for the same with great animations and navigations. - Cursor AI, Claude
    3. Help me align the landing page properly. Add proper spacing between each elements and sections. There shouldn't be any overlapping of elements. - Cursor AI
    4. Generate a ReadME file for the landing page as explained above. Do not spare any details. The ReadME file should be explained in detail about what this project is and the features in it. Also, add the installation guide to run this website for both windows and linux users. - Chatgpt


## AI vs Manual Work Split

    AI-generated: To be honest, this whole project is done by AI. Ofcourse there    were a few problems with the initial code, so I had to give a basic initial structure to it. But then, most of the code is generated by AI (almost 85-90%).
    Manual Coding: I did almost 10-15% of coding in this project and to be honest, I used AI in almost every other aspect. The initial basic structure and a few problems were fixed by me.
    Customization: Well, I was quick to adapt to the Cursor IDE and used it to full extent. I have been using Chatgpt for a while now, but whenever I get a chance to explore different AI tools, I never back off. I love exploring new AI tools and hence have become quite adaptable to them.
